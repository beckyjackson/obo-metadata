bfo				The http://purl.obolibary.org/obo/bfo/classes-only.owl variant of BFO ("bfo_classes_only.owl") includes only the class hierarchy and annotations from the full OWL version of BFO 2: http://purl.obolibary.org/obo/bfo.owl ("bfo.owl"). There are no object properties or logical axioms that use the object properties in bfo_classes_only.owl. As the logical axioms in the bfo_classes_only.owl variant are limited to subclass and disjoint assertions they are much weaker than the logical axioms in bfo.owl. If you plan to use the relations that define BFO 2, you should import bfo.owl instead of bfo_classes_only.owl. To the extent that the relations are used without importing bfo.owl, be mindful that they should be used in a manner consistent with their use in bfo.owl. Otherwise if your ontology is imported by a another ontology that imports bfo.owl there may be inconsistencies.  See the BFO 2 release notes for further information about BFO 2. Please note that the current release of bfo.owl uses temporal relations when the subject or object is a continuant, a major change from BFO 1.	This is an early version of BFO version 2 and has not yet been extensively reviewed by the project team members. Please see the project site http://code.google.com/p/bfo/ , the bfo2 owl discussion group http://groups.google.com/group/bfo-owl-devel , the bfo2 discussion group http://groups.google.com/group/bfo-devel, the tracking google doc http://goo.gl/IlrEE, and the current version of the bfo2 reference http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/dev/bfo2-reference.docx . This ontology is generated from a specification at http://bfo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/ontology/owl-group/specification/ and with the code that generates the OWL version in http://bfo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/tools/. A very early version of BFO version 2 in CLIF is at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/dev/bfo.clif

obi	Ontology for Biomedical Investigation	The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is build in a collaborative, international effort and will serve as a resource for annotating biomedical investigations, including the study design, protocols and instrumentation used, the data generated and the types of analysis performed on the data. This ontology arose from the Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology (FuGO) and will contain both terms that are common to all biomedical investigations, including functional genomics investigations and those that are more domain specific.		Please cite the OBI consortium http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi where traditional citation is called for. However it is adequate that individual terms be attributed simply by use of the identifying PURL for the term, in projects that refer to them.

cdao	Comparative Data Analysis Ontology	The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character.

Note regarding term synonyms:Some synonyms listed in this ontology are synonyms for terms and classes as they were used in published microbiological taxonomic descriptions.  Thus, the synonyms are not necessarily applicable to the wider world.  If the term synonyms could not be classified as broad, exact, or narrow synonyms, they were labeled as related synonyms.  The synonym lists were developed to facilitate the automated extraction of phenotypic data and character states from prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions using a natural language processing algorithm (MicroPIE).

mod				Annotation note 1 - "[PSI-MOD:ref]" has been replaced by PubMed:18688235.	Annotation note 2 - When an entry in the RESID Database is annotated with different sources because the same modification can arise from different encoded amino acids, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different source instance carries the RESID cross-reference followed by a hash symbol "#" and a 3 or 4 character label. When an entry in the RESID Database is annotated as a general modification with the same enzymatic activity producing different chemical structures depending on natural variation in the nonproteinaceous substrate, on secondary modifications that do not change the nature of the primary modification, or on a combination of a primary and one or more secondary modifications on the same residue, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different instance carries the RESID cross-reference followed by the special tag "#var".	Annotation note 3 - When an entry in the UniMod database is annotated as a general modification, and one or more instance sites are listed, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different site instance carries the UniMod cross-reference followed by a hash symbol and an amino acid code, "N-term" or "C-term".	Annotation note 4 - The elemental formulas are in strict alphabetical order, not in CAS ("C" and "H" first) order. Isotope numbers are in parentheses before the element symbol, and an element should not occur in a formula both with and without an isotope number. In difference formulas, counts can be zero or negative.	Annotation note 5 - In entries with an isotope indicator in the formula, average masses are meaningless and are assigned the value equal to the monoisotopic mass, but rounded to a lower precision; monoisotopic masses are calculated by using the masses for the indicated isotopes and the most common isotopes for other elements without isotope indicators in the formulas.	Annotation note 6 - For cross-link modifications, the number following "Cross-link" in the comment record indicates the number of amino acid residues that appear in the origin record, used to check the difference formula and masses. This usage differs from RESID, where the cross-link number indicates the maximum number of peptide chains that can be cross-linked.	Annotation note 7 - The synonym cross-reference "MOD:old name" has been replaced by "MOD:alternate name".	Annotation note 8 - The DeltaMass listings for free amino acids have been removed. Most UniMod entries that have not been "approved" have by general agreement not been incorporated unless there has been a request for a specific term by a PRIDE submitter.	Annotation note 9 - The Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm, OMSSA, enumerated list of modifications are being incorporated. The string values are synonyms with the synonymtypedef "OMSSA-label", and their integer values (which are supposed to be stable) are definition cross-references.

Terms from OGMS hang from the Basic Formal Ontology.The latest version of OGMS is always available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ogms.owlThis is version 2011-09-20 aka '0.9'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ogms/2011-09-20/ogms.owlThe OGMS developer site is http://code.google.com/p/ogms/The discussion group is http://groups.google.com/group/ogms-discussIf you are interested in participating in the development of OGMS, please send email to albertgoldfain@gmail.com. Be sure to include a google-account username with your request (this will be the username associated with a gmail address).	This ontology is in early development. Expect it to change.

ohd				Status of this document: This is a work in progress and we do not yet make any promises about the stability of URIs. A known issue is that the upper level of this ontology is an exploratory version of BFO developed in the interim between when BFO 1 was current and before BFO 2 development started. The representation of the CDT codes is tentative - we are discussing this with the ADA. The integration between OBI and OGMS is not complete - we add some axioms here in order to use both in a consistent way. The version of the subject of the FMA used here is an automatic translation of a portion of the entities and relations present in the original FMA. Work is ongoing on improving this subset and using an up-to-date version of the FMA as its basis.	The Oral Health and Disease Ontology is an ontology built to be compatible with the OBO Foundry ontologies, and is a collaboration between researchers at the University at Buffalo School of Dental Medicine, the University of Pittsburg School of Dental Medicine, and the Oregon Health and Science University.This ontology is licensed under the CC-BY License. Please see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/	Attribution is satisfied by using the URIs defined in this file when using terms from this ontology.	This version of the ontology has the imports merged and inferred-axioms added. The development version is at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ohd/dev/ohd.owl	This ontology is in early development. Expect it to change.	This document was an early experimental prototype of bfo2, not blessed by the working group. It is archived because it was used by some projects. There was very little change other than ids relative to earlier versions of BFO, and ids used here will be used in the ultimate release

ontoneo				PERSON: Fernanda FarinelliOntONeo development prioritizes the reuse of classes and entities from FMA ontology to deal with human anatomy approaches. Every class reference of others ontology for the anatomy domain, for example, UBERON and CARO, in which has the cross-reference annotation to some FMA class are replaced by the FMA class referred.	PERSON: Fernanda FarinelliOntoneo is a ontology that the development is in progress, then take in mind for while the stability of URIs and labels. We are sure that the upper level ontology used is BFO version 2 and that we are priorize the reuse of terms find on OBO Foundry ontologies.	IDs allocated to individuals: ONTONEO_90000000 - ONTONEO_99999999	OntoNeo, is developed by Fernanda Farinelli and her contributor group is licensed under CC BY 4.0.	PERSON: Fernanda FarinelliThe default language of this ontology is English mainly because the reusable ontologies are conceived in English. However, this ontology intends to be bilingual in order to attend the necessities of Brazilian issues. Then, every relevant term we defined in Portuguese (Brazilian portuguese) using the tag xml:lang="pt" the follow annotations: label, definition, alternative term.
