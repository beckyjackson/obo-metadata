Status of this document: This is a work in progress and we do not yet make any promises about the stability of URIs. A known issue is that the upper level of this ontology is an exploratory version of BFO developed in the interim between when BFO 1 was current and before BFO 2 development started. The representation of the CDT codes is tentative - we are discussing this with the ADA. The integration between OBI and OGMS is not complete - we add some axioms here in order to use both in a consistent way. The version of the subject of the FMA used here is an automatic translation of a portion of the entities and relations present in the original FMA. Work is ongoing on improving this subset and using an up-to-date version of the FMA as its basis.

This version of the ontology has the imports merged and inferred-axioms added. The development version is at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ohd/dev/ohd.owl

This ontology is in early development. Expect it to change.

This document was an early experimental prototype of bfo2, not blessed by the working group. It is archived because it was used by some projects. There was very little change other than ids relative to earlier versions of BFO, and ids used here will be used in the ultimate release
