Many thanks to Chris Mungall (LBNL), Elvis Hsin-Hui Wu (University of Arizona), Gail Gasparich (Towson University), and Gordon Burleigh (University of Florida) for comments and/or assistance with ontology construction and compilation of taxonomic descriptions and term definitions.  Thanks to Oliver He (University of Michigan) for technical assistance with OntoBee and OntoFox, and Gareth Owen (ChEBI project leader, head curator) and other curators at ChEBI for assistance in the incorporation of microbial-specific chemical terms and synonyms into ChEBI.  Thanks also to the instructors (Melissa Haendel, Matt Yoder, Jim Baihoff) and students of the 2013 NESCent Ontologies for Evolutionary Biology workshop, and to Karen Cranston (NESCent director) and the support staff at NESCent.  This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation Assembling the Tree of Life Program (DBI-1208534), and by a travel grant to attend the 2013 NESCent Ontologies for Evolutionary Biology workshop.

MicrO (An Ontology of Prokaryotic Phenotypic and Metabolic Characters).  Version 1.3 released 3/23/2016.  Includes terms and term synonyms extracted from &gt; 1500 prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions, collected from a large number of taxonomic descriptions from Archaea, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Mollicutes.  The ontology and the synonym lists were developed to facilitate the automated extraction of phenotypic data and character states from prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions using a natural language processing algorithm (MicroPIE).  MicroPIE is currently being developed by Hong Cui, Elvis Hsin-Hui Wu, and Jin Mao (University of Arizona) in collaboration with Carrine E. Blank (University of Montana) and Lisa R. Moore (University of Southern Maine).  A description and link to MicroPIE can be found at http://avatol.org/ngp/nlp/overview-2/.  The most current version of MicrO can be downloaded from https://github.com/carrineblank/MicrO.

Note regarding term synonyms:  Some synonyms listed in this ontology are synonyms for terms and classes as they were used in published microbiological taxonomic descriptions.  Thus, the synonyms are not necessarily applicable to the wider world.  If the term synonyms could not be classified as broad, exact, or narrow synonyms, they were labeled as related synonyms.  The synonym lists were developed to facilitate the automated extraction of phenotypic data and character states from prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions using a natural language processing algorithm (MicroPIE).
